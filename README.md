# Multi-step form

[Project in production](https://multistep-form-liart.vercel.app/?#/)

## üìÑ Summary

This is a project created with the purpose of showcasing my abilities in front end web development. It renders a multi step form for a fictional gaming company, with steps to conclude a plan selection. It cycles throught 5 steps, from providing personal info, selecting the recurrence, adding extras and a checkout and thank you section.

## ‚öôÔ∏è The stack

This form is fully validated with user-friendly interface - disabled buttons, error messages, memory-persistent informations from step to step and page reloading.

Here it was used the following stack:

- Vue 3 (3.2.29);
- Quasar (2.8.0);
- Pinia (2.0.11);
- TailwindCSS (3.4.1);
- TypeScript (4.5.4);
- Vite (1.4.3);
- Prettier (3.2.4);
- Prettier Tailwind (0.5.11);
- ESLint (8.11.0);

## üíªÔ∏è The code - in details

There's three videos that explains the project as a whole, the code, architectures, good practices, extras and more. It is highly recommended the watching of these videos, although they are in pt-BR.
